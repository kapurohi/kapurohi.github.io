This paper studies the problem of non-word spell checking by characterizing mistyping in the English language as an example of a noisy channel. It combats the noisy distortion of words by implementing a Bayesian spellcheck model, which generates a conditional probability distribution over possible corrections. A major feature of this model is the usage of the Levenshtein distance, a string metric that quantifies the distance between words. We train our model and apply it to several misspellings to evaluate this correction strategy. Finally, we discuss possible improvements and contextualize our study within the broader field of language processing.
