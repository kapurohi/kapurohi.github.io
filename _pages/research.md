<!-- Research experience
====== -->
**Research Assistant - UC Davis Math Department** (Davis, CA)

  **Biharmonic Operator Research** (April 2024 - Present)
  * Working on the Laplacian Eigenvalue function and Green's Theorem for the Biharmonic Operator in one-dimension numerically.
  * Leveraging expertise in numerical analysis and computational techniques to address challenges in analyzing the Laplacian Eigenvalue function and applying Green's Theorem to the Biharmonic Operator.
  * Conducted pioneering research in numerical methods and demonstrated proficiency in computational mathematics and algorithm development.

  **Springer Fiber Research** (January 2023 - Present)
  * Conducting research on the Irreducible components of Springer Fibers within n-dimensional complex space, specifically two-column case.
  * Proving that arbitrary intersections of Irreducible components of a two-column Delta-Springer Fiber is an iterated Grassmannian Fiber bundle.
  * Conducting advanced research with a focus on their applications in algebraic geometry and combinatorics.

  **Polyharmonic Trigonometric Transform Research** (September 2023 - April 2024)
  * Investigated the mathematical foundations of polyharmonic local trigonometric transforms, explored their properties, and advanced the theoretical understanding of their applications in image processing.
  * Developed efficient algorithms and methodologies for implementing polyharmonic local trigonometric transforms in the context of image processing.
  * Applied polyharmonic local trigonometric transforms to real-world image processing challenges, with a focus on optimizing efficiency, and improving image quality, and identified novel applications that leverage the unique features of these transforms.
